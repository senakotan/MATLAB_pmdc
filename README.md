# PMDC Motor Modeling and Simulation with Simulink and Simscape

## Project Description
This project focuses on the modeling and simulation of a Permanent Magnet DC (PMDC) motor based on electromechanical energy conversion principles.  
The objective is to analyze the dynamic behavior of the motor by establishing both a mathematical model and a physical component-based model.

Two different modeling approaches are implemented and compared:
- Equation-based modeling using Simulink block diagrams
- Physical system modeling using the Simscape library

---

## Theoretical Background
A PMDC motor operates with a constant magnetic flux generated by permanent magnets placed on the stator.  
Unlike separately excited DC motors, no field current is required, and the magnetic flux is assumed to be constant.

Key characteristics:
- Constant magnetic flux (Φ = constant)
- Back electromotive force proportional to angular speed
- Electromagnetic torque proportional to armature current
- High starting current and simple controllability

## Simulation Parameters
The simulations are performed using the following parameters:

| Parameter | Value |
|---------|------|
| Armature Resistance (Ra) | 7 Ω |
| Armature Inductance (La) | 0.12 H |
| Supply Voltage (Va) | 6 V |
| Load Torque (TL) | 0.003 N·m |
| Rotor Inertia (J) | 1.61e-6 kg·m² |
| Viscous Friction (B) | 6.04e-6 N·m/(rad/s) |
| Motor Constant (Kv) | 0.0141 V·s/rad |

Simulation time interval: **0 – 3 seconds**

## Modeling Approaches

### 1. Simulink Block Diagram Model
In this approach, the differential equations of the PMDC motor are directly implemented using basic Simulink blocks.

The model consists of:
- Electrical loop for armature current dynamics
- Mechanical loop for angular speed dynamics
- Cross-coupling blocks to represent torque and back EMF

This method clearly illustrates the interaction between electrical and mechanical subsystems.

### 2. Simscape Physical Model
The Simscape-based model represents the motor using physical components rather than explicit equations.

Used components:
- Electrical elements: Resistor, Inductor, DC Voltage Source
- Mechanical elements: Inertia, Rotational Damper
- Electromechanical interface: Rotational Electromechanical Converter

This approach provides a more realistic representation of physical behavior and energy flow.

## Results and Observations
- High starting current is observed due to zero initial back EMF
- Motor speed increases as back EMF builds up
- Armature current decreases as speed approaches steady-state
- Electromagnetic torque follows armature current behavior
- Both modeling approaches yield consistent dynamic responses
